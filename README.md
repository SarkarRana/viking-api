 - API Requests & Responses: Make HTTP requests, view detailed responses, and monitor headers, body, and status codes.
- Query Parameter Input: Easy-to-use interface for adding and managing query parameters.
- Performance Monitoring: Measure and display API call durations, letting users analyze response time and performance.
- Custom Headers: Add and manage custom headers for each request.
Save & Reuse Requests: Save your commonly used requests and load them whenever you need.
- Light & Dark Themes: Switch between light and dark themes for a more comfortable user experience.
- Beautiful UI: Built with ReactJS and styled using Chakra UI and React Icons for a modern, intuitive design.

### # Why Tauri?
Tauri is a modern alternative to Electron that provides a smaller app size, faster performance, and better security. It allows VikingAPI to be lightweight and efficient, while React takes care of the UI/UX.

## How to Run VikingAPI Locally üñ•Ô∏è
